Hey guys sorry for keeping you guys waiting <:FeelsSadMan:455783807472369664>  documents for going to SEA is just pain in the ass because I can't get QR code for my vaccine record because I got my vac all from different states <:NotLikeThis:722796079439020103>  I slept at 6am trying to get QR code <:KEK:832392219376746498> still haven't figured out and went to CVS in the morning and they said they can't combine too I got everything else ready but QR code is being pain in the ass <:FeelsSadMan:455783807472369664> if it takes too long I might go to Australia for the time being till I get all the things sorted out since I got my visa for Australia just now

Anyway I'm going to do what I said yesterday opening Christmas po box and cooking Stream tomorrow 

 > Around 12~1 PM Local time
<t:1649779200> ~ <t:1649782800>

And today I'm gonna take a day off trying to get all combined QR code or get ticket to Australia if I can't get it till tonight so I can actually go somewhere instead of waiting around 

Thanks for waiting ! I'll update more soon! 
Have a good day! 
@everyone
