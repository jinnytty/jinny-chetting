Yo! I arrived Australia ! But I don't think I can do evening stream today because literally all my stuffs are still in Singapore <:FeelsSadMan:455783807472369664> the layover was too short and the first flight was delayed so all my stuffs  couldn't make it which includes my phone/battery pack chargers/ makeup and clothes. I only have my laptop, empty portable batteries, 3 dead phones and one with 20 percent battery so I can only stream for like 30 mins <:KEK:832392219376746498>  messy hair and non washed face <:KEK:832392219376746498> plus it's raining 🌧 luggages are gonna arrive in 24~48 hrs so instead of streaming today, im going to go get some basic stuffs I need for streaming and also to clean up and jacket it's cold here. 
 I feel sadge as much as you guys to not being able to explore Sydney today but we will have fun from tomorrow!!!! 🇦🇺 🐨 🦘
